kmy3uka is a little Qt program that takes a top directory full of
artists' directories with each artist directory containing directories
of albums and "pretty-print"s information to a chosen text file
(appending).  Additional file extensions.ini may specify what file
extensions would count for music files.  A resulting file may be found
in the download section.  It may be useful for systematizing large
music collections with directory hierarchy as specified above.
