kmy3uka is a little Qt program that takes a top directory full of
artists' directories with each artist directory containing directories
of albums and "pretty-print"s information to a chosen text file
(appending).  Additional file extensions.ini may specify what file
extension would count for music files.  A resulting file may be found
at http://m00natic.hit.bg/my3uka.txt
It may be useful for systematizing large music collections with
directory hierarchy as specified above.
